## :calendar: Timeline

To achieve all the goals of the project, the following deadline was planned and followed. The timeline was created in communication with my mentors while putting my expertise and the expectations for the project under consideration.

### Stage A: Community Bonding and Reviewing Relevant Literature (May 17 - June 6, 2021)

In this stage, I introduced myself to the mentors and the organization. I acquired the electronic sensors, the 3d printed parts and agree on the extra equipment that may be necessary. I also searched online for relevant projects and resources. 

### Stage B: Studying Previous Project (June 7 - June 20, 2021)

I got familiar with the existing tutorials and guidelines from the previous GSoC project. 
This is of huge importance and required a lot of work to be done. My experience with the development
of the project so far helped me adjust the ideas to a practical and realistic plan.

### Stage C: Integrating NodeRED Programming (June 21 - July 21, 2021)

In this stage, I aimed to level up the expectations for this project. During this period, I tried to
integrate the simple visual programming language Node-RED to be able to control
functionalities of the robot, such as movement and light patterns. Node-RED is a programming language specifically
designed to be user-friendly. It captures the essence of programming, which is to model
instructions that a robot can use. This gives the chance for young students to get hands-on
experience with programming and most importantly see their programming work come to life
through the robot.

### Stage D: Implementing learning scenarios and examples (July 21 - August 15, 2021)

During this stage, I developed several new guidelines and use cases. 
A list of the learning scenarios available follows. Simple tasks were developed using the RaspberryPi, so educators can get the grasp of it, without going straight to hard implementation with complex circuits. Harder examples were also developed for more experienced users.

* control LED light and create patterns
* achieve forward and backward movement of motors and rotation of the robot
* achieve robot movement in a rectangle pattern
* read odometer and ultrasonic sensor measurements
* develop "stop before obstacle" scenario, where the robot can detect surrounding objects and stop before a collision
* save the state of the robot and visualize the route it follows in 2d space 

The aforementioned tutorials are supported using Node-RED. This way, students can get in touch with programming
and experience the effects in real-life applications.

### Stage E: Writing Documentation, Adding Images (August 7 - August 23, 2021)

This stage was an attempt to make the project more accessible to the public. I made detailed guidelines using markdown files with images that are more intuitive for educators and students. I also systematized the way people can contact us and contribute to the project. Building a community around the project was an important goal from the beginning of the project.

### Stage F: Brainstorming, Addressing Final Issues (August 7 - August 23, 2021)

In fear that the timeline is overly optimistic this period was dedicated to making sure that all previous stages have been completed. Furthermore, this was a timeslot dedicated to experimentation with ideas that emerged during my work experience on the project.

### Stage G: Future Development (September 1 - December 25, 2021)

The engagement with the project will continue after the end of the GSoC program. My mentors and I have created a team that aspires to attract interest in the project and promote our efforts to support its dissemination to educators' communities.
In communication with the mentors, we have set goals of creating a community around the project, adding extra functionalities to the robot and developing additional software, in a dynamic process where we will be receiving feedback by the educational community in Greece.
