## :calendar: Timeline (gsoc-2019, Christos)


The implementation details follow, organized by [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).

## Phase 1 (May 27 - Jun 28)


The proper electronic parts selected for that project and  designed,printed and tested the 3D parts of the robot in a modular way with a tool-less philosophy. 

- Selection of electronic parts
- 3D designs :triangular_ruler:
- Parts printing stage
- Functionality tests of the parts
- Robot Assembly :wrench:

## Phase 2 (Jun 29 - Jul 26)


New libraries created for the communication between hardware-software.  A object oriented way for programming selected and the integration with Jupyter completed. 

- Control library
- Vision library
- OpenCV integration
- Special control and functionality library (e.x. PID Controller)
- Jupyter Notebook integration
- Wireless access, control and programming of the program achieved 

## Phase 3 (Jul 27 - Aug 26)


All the needed preparations completed  for easy deployment of software and material for the courses, user manuals and instructions created.

- Modifications of Rasbian image
- Courses on Jupyter Notebook (e.x. Line Follower robot)
- PDFs with extensive instructions for the assembly and usage of the robot
- Final debugging
- Wiki page created




## :calendar: Timeline (gsoc-2021, Giorgos)


The implementation details follow, organized by [GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline).
After communication with the mentors, we concluded to a flexible timeline. Currently, the timeline has the following structure. 
After communication with the my mentors, given my expertise and the expecations for the project, the estimated workhours should be per 15 hours a week, that is 3 hours a day.

## Stage A: Community Bonding and Review Relevant Literature (May 17 - June 6, 2021)

In this stage, I introduce myself to the mentors and the organisation. I acquire the electronic sensors, the 3d printed parts and agree on the extra equipement that may be necessary. I will also search online for relevant projects and resources. 

## Stage B: Studying Previous Project (June 7 - June 20, 2021)

I also get familiar with the existing tutorials and guidelines from the previous GSoC project. 
This is of hube importance and requires a lot of work to be done. My experience with the developement
of the projct so far will help me adjust the ideas to a practical and realistic plan.

## Stage C: Integrating Scratch or NodeRED Programming (June 21 - July 21, 2021)

In this stage, I aim to level up the expectations for this project. In this time period, I will try to
integrate a simple visual programming language like Scratch or NodeRED to be able to control
the dance and light patterns. Scratch and NodeRED are programming languages specifically
designed to be user friendly. They capture the essence of programming, which is to model
instructions that a robot can use. This will give the chance for young students to get hands-on
experience with programming and most importantly see their programming work come to life
through the robot.

The scenarios of stage C will be used transformed later to support intergration with NodeRED or Scratch. 

## Stage D: Implementing of new learning scenarios (July 21 - August 15, 2021)

This stage is parallel to stage D. During this stage, I plan to develop several new guidelines and use cases. 
Some use cases will focus on using simple tasks only with the RaspberryPi, so educators can get the grasp of it, without
going straight to hard implementation with complex circuits.
Examples include:
* LED ligths control

The aforementioned tutorials will also be supported using NodeRED or Scratch. This way, students can get in touch with programming
and experience the effects in real-life applications.

As I gain more experience, the scenarios will contain more tutorials and guidelines for the robot.
The most important implementation are the following:
* obstacle avoidance - detect wall and stop (implementing the logic using subflows and Node-Red, this will help students develop programming intuition visually) 
* control pattern movement of the robot (using Node-Red)
* Dancing Robot and musical light show

After that, I will add the color detection sensor and develop a line following implementation:
* Line following scenario

## Stage E: Creating Website, Writing Documentation, Adding Pictures, Filming and Editing Videos (August 7 - August 23, 2021)

This stage will be an attempt to make the project more accessible to the public. I plan to make analytic guidelines using jupyter notebooks and video tutorials that will be more intuitive for teachers. I will also systematise the way people can contact us and contribute to the project. Building a community around the project is a goal I aspire to achieve.


## Stage F: Brainstorming (August 7 - August 23, 2021)

In fear that the timeline is overly optimistic this time period is dedicated to make sure that all
previous stages have been completed. Furthermore, this is a timeslot dedicated to experimentation with ideas 
that will emerge during my work experience on the project.
