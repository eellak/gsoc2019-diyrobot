# stop before obstacle

In this example, the robot uses the ultrasonic sensor and its motors. 
A stopping distance threshold for obstacles around is defined and keeps moving until the distance threshold is met.
Using the laws of motion, the studens can get familiar with accelaration, velocity and inertia. 

The user can experiment with different distance threshold and check wethear the robot will actually stop before the obstacle. The robot could also start breaking early, thus hitting on an obstacle. That is why we suggest using beg distance threshold at the start of this experiment and decrease the threshold slowly.
