# move in rectangles

In this example, we make a flow to control a robot. 
We use http requests as subflows to move the motors of the robot forward and backward and to rotate it. 
The user can use the delays to control the time of movement and thus the distacne travelled. 
He can also change the direction of movement and rotation and create more complex routes.
